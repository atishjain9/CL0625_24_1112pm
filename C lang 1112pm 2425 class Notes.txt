What is Programming Language?
giving instructions to the computer for performing tasks.

Language?
its a tool for communication

communication:
to exchange ideas or information

What is C?
It is a high Level programming language
Dennis Ritchie 
1972

What is C?
C is a General-Purpose, High-Level Programming Language Developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at AT&T Bell labs of USA.

Dennis Ritchie is known as Father of C Language.
Mother of all Modern Programming Languages/Beginner Programming Language
Ancestors of C:

1967 – BCPL- Martin Richards
1970 – B- Ken Thompson

K&R Standard
    In 1978, Brain Kernighan(UNIX) & Dennis Ritchie(C) produced first publicly Available description of C (The C     Programming language), known as the K&R Standard, Both added lots of features to c language.
ANSI C / ISO C:
     In 1983, C is standardized by ANSI, and later by ISO

BCPL – Basic Combined Programming Language
AT&T – American Tele Communications & Technologies
ANSI – American National Standard Institute
ISO – International Standard Organisation

Features of C Language:
----------------------
1. General Purpose Language
2. High Level Language
3. Structured Language
4. Middle Level Language
5. Portable
6. Modularization
7. Procedure Oriented - pop
8. Rich Library
9. Extensible
10. Fast & Efficient ******

32 keywords + approx 400 Library functions + syntax = c language

speical files  - header files

stdio.h
conio.h
math.h
string.h
29 approx header files

Special software - Compiler

c software = 32 keywords + 29 header files + compiler + debugger + linker + editor --> IDE
IDE - Integrated DEvelopemnt eniorment

------------------------

Turbo c2/c3 - 
Code Blocks
Dev C++
C - Free
VS CODE

---------
We are using CodeBlocks for writing programs

First Example










# include <stdio.h>
